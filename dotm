			with planets on strings, she slips
			and slides across the room<br/>
			in mismatched socks<br/>
			digging through her chest of drawers<br/>
			to find—<br/>
			<br/>

			a-ha! she pulls from her front overalls pocket<br/>
			a match—she strikes it, throws it<br/>
			into the inky black; sparks<br/>
			skitter across the hardwood floor<br/>
			snagging on the vast net of her bedroom walls<br/>
			<br/>

			her glinting laugh bubbles<br/>
			into the room’s shadowed corners<br/>
			where coppery worlds dance<br/>
			(you can still see them<br/>
			if you rub your eyes hard enough)<br/>
			<br/>

			she kicks a comet aside<br/>
			like a neon light it illuminates her face;<br/>
			her freckles glitter and glow<br/>
			like the galaxies that swirl around her<br/>
			as she begins to fade from view—<br/>
			<br/>

			when you wake, you blink<br/>
			the last shards of stardust from your gaze<br/>
			her whisper tickles your ear:<br/>
			open your eyes;<br/>
			the world is beautiful today.
